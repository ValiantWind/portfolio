## Linking your github repo
This project utilises the modified version of <a href="https://github.com/Tarptaeya/repo-card">Repo-Card</a> which utilises Github Free API to fetch details.

Keep in mind that the Free API is Rate Limited.

Format:

```
<div class="repo-card" data-repo="username/repository"></div>
```

Just change ```username``` and ```repository``` to yours and you are good to go!
